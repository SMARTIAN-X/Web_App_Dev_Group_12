## CONTRIBUTIONS

1. AKINNAWO TOMIWA SMART 23/1874
   I worked on the db.php and the take_quiz.php. The db.php connects the project to the database and the take_quiz.php allows the users to take the online quiz where the participants would input their name and proceed to take the quiz. The name input makes it compulsory for participants to put in their name before they proceed to submit the quiz and I also used internal styling for the css of the file.


2. AIBOR VERA EBOSETALE 23/2607
   I worked on the view_results.php.This file displays the quiz score for every participant that partook in the quiz after submission. it fetches the scores from the database and presents them in a clear format. I also used internal styling for it.


3. HENRY TIMOTHY ISAIAH 23/2550
   I worked on the submit_quiz.php. This page handles the process after a participant submits their quiz. It collects the quiz answers, calculates the user's total score, and saves the results into the database. I also ensured the script validates the answers properly and gives feedback to user once their submission is successful.


4. MADUKANZE CHINONSO VICTORY 23/2409
   I worked on the view_individual_result.php. This displays the detailed result of each student's  quiz attempt. It retrieves the user's score, answers and performance from the database and shows them.
